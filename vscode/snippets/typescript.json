  // Place your snippets for typescript here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and
  // description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the
  // same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "Type GraphQL Resolver": {
    "prefix": "resolver",
    "body": [
      "import { Resolver } from \"type-graphql\";",
      "",
      "@Resolver()",
      "export class $1Resolver {",
      "  @$2()",
      "  async $3() {}",
      "}"
    ],
    "description": "TypeGraphQL Resolver"
  },
  "Util Function": {
    "prefix": "ut",
    "body": [
      "export const $TM_FILENAME_BASE = () => {",
      "",
      "}"
    ],
    "description": "Util Function"
  },
  "console.log": {
    "prefix": "cl",
    "body": ["console.log($1)"],
    "description": "console.log"
  }
